## Goals of the project
Obtaining a clean dataset that is rid of missing valued, irrelevant columns in order to aid further analysis.
Analyzing the contributing factors that lead to the prediction of early Alzheimer's Disease. 
Furthermore, analyzing the dataset and observing trends in various values in the dataset through visualization.
